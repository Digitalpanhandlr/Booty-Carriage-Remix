A remix of the booty carriage, digital remix is designed with a couple extra tie down points for extruder cable / eddy / carto cable..... as well as the top "cable chain" mount is now replaced with a bigger hole for a ECAS04 ptfe fitting to hold a ptfe tube (small one when im printing regular filaments, or regular ptfe when im printing tpu with the small ptfe...)

the other 'digital theft remix" is just his original carriage, with the rear cutout...
